\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Enbang Li for his advice and support throughout the writing of this thesis. I am grateful to Martin Morillas, for his patient oversight and induction of the Terahertz Imaging lab as well as his assistance in my experimental work.

I owe a great debt of gratitude to Dr. Shanhui Fan of Stanford University for his insightful comments and suggestions on my paper. Likewise, I am indebted to Dr. Jerry Shi who provided invaluable tips on implementing his numerical method, without which this thesis would not have been possible. My thanks also go to Dr. Ardavan Oskooi of the Ab Initio research group for answering my simulation questions as well as providing the immensely useful \textit{MPB} band-structure program.

To my friends and family: I could not have done this without you. In particular, my parents Dorothy and Tony, who have continually supported me. I dedicate this thesis to my grandmother Helen Koletti, and hope she would have been proud.
