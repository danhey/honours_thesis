abstract = {Summary The biconjugate gradient (BCG) method is the “natural” generalization of the classical conjugate gradient algorithm for Hermitian positive definite matrices to general non-Hermitian linear systems. Unfortunately, the original BCG algorithm is susceptible to possible breakdowns and numerical instabilities. In this paper, we present a novel BCG-like approach, the quasi-minimal residual (QMR) method, which overcomes the problems of BCG. An implementation of QMR based on a look-ahead version of the nonsymmetric Lanczos algorithm is proposed. It is shown how BCG iterates can be recovered stably from the QMR process. Some further properties of the QMR approach are given and an error bound is presented. Finally, numerical experiments are reported.},

abstract = {Photons are neutral particles that do not interact directly with a magnetic field. However, recent theoretical work has shown that an effective magnetic field for photons can exist if the phase of light changes with its direction of propagation. This direction-dependent phase indicates the presence of an effective magnetic field, as shown experimentally for electrons in the Aharonov–Bohm experiment. Here, we replicate this experiment using photons. To create this effective magnetic field we construct an on-chip silicon-based Ramsey-type interferometer. This interferometer has been traditionally used to probe the phase of atomic states and here we apply it to probe the phase of photonic states. We experimentally observe an effective magnetic flux between 0 and 2$\pi$ corresponding to a non-reciprocal 2$\pi$ phase shift with an interferometer length of 8.35 mm and an interference-fringe extinction ratio of 2.4 dB. This non-reciprocal phase is comparable to those of common monolithically integrated magneto-optical materials.},

abstract = {The ability to manipulate the frequency of light is of great importance in both fundamental quantum sciences and practical applications. Traditional method for frequency conversion relies on nonlinear optical processes, which are faced with the obstacles of low efficiency and limited bandwidth. Recent developments of topological photonics introduce the concepts of gauge potentials and magnetic fields to the realm of photons. Here, we demonstrate versatile frequency manipulation of light via photonic gauge potentials in a fiber-optic communication system. The gauge potential of frequency dimension is realized by controlling the initial phase of electro-optic phase modulation. A maximum 50 GHz frequency shift and three-fold bandwidth expansion for frequency combs are achieved by choosing different gauge potentials. By adopting two cascaded phase modulators with different gauge potentials, we also realize "negative refraction" for frequency combs and frequency "perfect imaging"for arbitrarily input spectra. These results may pave the way towards versatile frequency management in quantum optics and classical optical communications.},

abstract = {Non-static media have recently raised significant attention in the research community for their ability to break reciprocity without the use of magnetic fields. Different approaches to realize such media have been proposed in electromagnetics and acoustics, including mechanical motion and spatiotemporal modulation. Here, we connect these two approaches and show that they can both be derived from the same fundamental relativistic principles. We start our analysis with linear mechanical motion, and show that in the case of near-zero refractive index it is possible to achieve positive and negative refractive index for opposite propagation directions. Next, we show that a similar effect can be achieved with a moving Bragg grating, which can be realized through spatiotemporal modulation, thus avoiding any practically-challenging physical motion. We also show that similar remarks apply to the case of spinning ring resonators, which can form the basis of magnet-less acoustical and electromagnetic circulators. Finally, we discuss the consequences of the equivalence between physical motion and spatiotemporal modulation to applications beyond non-reciprocity, such as spontaneous light generation from dielectric or plasmonic slabs in relative motion with each other.},

abstract = {The objective of this dissertation is to investigate fundamental optical phenomena at the interface between two emerging fields of modern optics - structured light and micro/nano-structured optical materials. Until recently, these fields were developing in parallel yet independently. A majority of researchers in the field of metamaterials and photonic crystals considered "simple" linearly or circularly polarized light or Gaussian beam propagation in "structured" materials with properties not found in nature. However, in addition to conventional polarization states, light beams can be radially or azimuthally polarized and carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). A fascinating example of a beam carrying OAM is the optical vortex---a donut-shaped beam with a helical phase front. Similarly, the structured light community largely focused on complex light propagation in rather simple homogeneous, isotropic, transparent media. In this dissertation, we explore fundamentals and applications of light-matter interactions that involve both complex light and complex media. The central question that we aim to tackle is: How may the synergy of these two fields lead to a breakthrough in modern photonics? Structured materials, including metamaterials and photonic bandgap structures, realize unprecedented control over light propagation and design flexibility. They can enable new optical properties and functionalities, including new regimes of wave guiding, negative index of refraction, magnetism at optical frequencies, and subwavelength imaging to name a few. We demonstrate how nearly unlimited possibilities in engineering the properties of structured media can be used for generation and manipulation of structured light. Also, we show how the unique properties of structured light could be used for characterization of structured media.},

The SHE of light exhibits unique potential for exploring the physical properties of nanostructures, such as determining the optical thickness, and the material properties of metallic and magnetic thin films and even atomically thin two-dimensional materials. More importantly, it opens a possible pathway for controlling the spin states of photons and developing next-generation photonic spin Hall devices as a fundamental constituent of the emerging spinoptics. In this review, based on the viewpoint of the geometric phase gradient, we give a detailed presentation of the recent advances in the SHE of light and its applications in precision metrology and future spin-based photonics.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances in integrated photonics have spurred on the study of topological phenomena in engineered bosonic systems. Indeed, the controllability of silicon ring-resonator arrays has opened up new perspectives for building lattices for photons with topologically nontrivial bands and integrating them into photonic devices for practical applications. Here, we push these developments even further by exploiting the different modes of a silicon ring resonator as an extra dimension for photons. Tunneling along this synthetic dimension is implemented via an external time-dependent modulation that allows for the generation of engineered gauge fields. We show how this approach can be used to generate a variety of exciting topological phenomena in integrated photonics, ranging from a topologically-robust optical isolator in a spatially one-dimensional (1D) ring-resonator chain to a driven-dissipative analog of the 4D quantum Hall effect in a spatially 3D resonator lattice. Our proposal paves the way towards the use of topological effects in the design of novel photonic lattices supporting many frequency channels and displaying higher connectivities.},

abstract = {In this letter, we report the presence of novel type of plasmon Weyl points in a naturally existing material - magnetized plasma. In such a medium, conventional, purely longitudinal bulk plasma oscillations exists only along the direction of applied magnetic field (z direction). With strong enough magnetic field, there exist helical propagating modes along z direction with circular polarizations. The orthogonality between the longitudinal bulk plasmon mode and the transverse helical propagating modes guarantees their crossing at the bulk plasmon frequency. These crossing points, embedded in the bulk plasmon dispersion line, serve as monopoles in the k space - the so called Weyl points. These Weyl points lead to salient observable features. These include the highly intriguing observation that, at a magnetized plasma surface which is parallel to the applied magnetic field, reflection of an electromagnetic wave with in-plane wave-vector close to the Weyl points exhibits chiral behavior only in half of the k plane, which is bounded by the projection of the bulk plasmon dispersion line. We also verify the presence of 'Fermi arcs' connecting the two Weyl points with opposite chiralities when magnetized plasma interfaces with trivial photonic materials. Our study introduces the concept of Weyl photonics into homogeneous strongly dispersive photonic materials, which could pave way for realizing new topological photonic devices.},

abstract = {Neutral atomic Bose condensates and degenerate Fermi gases have been used to realize important many-body phenomena in their most simple and essential forms, without many of the complexities usually associated with material systems. However, the charge neutrality of these systems presents an apparent limitation-a wide range of intriguing phenomena arise from the Lorentz force for charged particles in a magnetic field, such as the fractional quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron systems. The limitation can be circumvented by exploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to create synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was demonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments on rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a magnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum rotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the difficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches are not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics. Here we experimentally realize an optically synthesized magnetic field for ultracold neutral atoms, which is evident from the appearance of vortices in our Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach uses a spatially dependent optical coupling between internal states of the atoms, yielding a Berry's phase sufficient to create large synthetic magnetic fields, and is not subject to the limitations of rotating systems. With a suitable lattice configuration, it should be possible to reach the quantum Hall regime, potentially enabling studies of topological quantum computation.},

abstract = {Weyl points in three-dimensional photonic crystals behave as monopoles of Berry flux in momentum space. Here, based on general symmetry analysis, we show that a minimal number of four symmetry-related (consequently equifrequency) Weyl points can be realized in time-reversal invariant photonic crystals. We further propose an experimentally-feasible way to modify double-gyroid photonic crystals to realize four equifrequency Weyl points, which is explicitly confirmed by our first-principle photonic band-structure calculations. Remarkably, photonic crystals with equifrequency Weyl points are qualitatively advantageous in applications including angular selectivity, frequency selectivity, invisibility cloaking, and three dimensional imaging.},

abstract = {Weyl fermions are massless chiral fermions that play an important role in quantum field theory but have never been observed as fundamental particles. A Weyl semimetal is an unusual crystal that hosts Weyl fermions as quasiparticle excitations and features Fermi arcs on its surface. Such a semimetal not only provides a condensed matter realization of the anomalies in quantum field theories but also demonstrates the topological classification beyond the gapped topological insulators. Here, we identify a topological Weyl semimetal state in the transition metal monopnictide materials class. Our first-principles calculations on TaAs reveal its bulk Weyl fermion cones and surface Fermi arcs. Our results show that in the TaAs-type materials the Weyl semimetal state does not depend on fine-tuning of chemical composition or magnetic order, which opens the door for the experimental realization of Weyl semimetals and Fermi arc surface states in real materials.},

@article{Fang2012a,
abstract = {The goal to achieve arbitrary control of photon flow has motivated much of the recent research on photonic crystals and metamaterials. As a new mechanism for controlling photon flow, we introduce a scheme that generates an effective magnetic field for photons. We consider a resonator lattice in which the coupling constants between the resonators are harmonically modulated in time. With appropriate choice of the spatial distribution of the modulation phases, an effective magnetic field for photons can be created, leading to a Lorentz force for photons and the emergence of topologically protected one-way photon edge states that are robust against disorders—without the use of magneto-optical effects.

abstract = {Topological insulators (TIs) are characterized by the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) on the topological surface states under time-reversal symmetry breaking. Motivated by recent experiments on the magneto-optical effects induced by the QAHE, we develop a theory for the dynamical Hall conductivity for subgap optical frequency and intense optical fields using the Keldysh-Floquet Green's function formalism. Our theory reveals a nonlinear regime in which the Hall conductivity remains close to {\$}e{\^{}}2/2h{\$} at low frequencies. At higher optical fields, we find that the subsequent collapse of the half quantization is accompanied by coherent oscillations of the dynamical Hall conductivity as a function of field strength, triggered by the formation of Floquet subbands and the concomitant inter-subband transitions.},

@article{Mansuripur2009a,
abstract = {We argue that the classical theory of electromagnetism is based on Maxwell's macroscopic equations, an energy postulate, a momentum postulate, and a generalized form of the Lorentz law of force. These seven postulates constitute the foundation of a complete and consistent theory, thus eliminating the need for actual (i.e., physical) models of polarization P and magnetization M, these being the distinguishing features of Maxwell's macroscopic equations. In the proposed formulation, P(r,t) and M(r,t) are arbitrary functions of space and time, their physical properties being embedded in the seven postulates of the theory. The postulates are self-consistent, comply with the requirements of the special theory of relativity, and satisfy the laws of conservation of energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum. One advantage of the proposed formulation is that it side-steps the long-standing Abraham-Minkowski controversy surrounding the electromagnetic momentum inside a material medium by simply "assigning" the Abraham momentum density E(r,t) x H(r,t)/c{\^{}}2 to the electromagnetic field. This well-defined momentum is thus taken to be universal as it does not depend on whether the field is propagating or evanescent, and whether or not the host medium is homogeneous, transparent, isotropic, dispersive, magnetic, linear, etc. In other words, the local and instantaneous momentum density is uniquely and unambiguously specified at each and every point of the material system in terms of the E and H fields residing at that point. Any variation with time of the total electromagnetic momentum of a closed system results in a force exerted on the material media within the system in accordance with the generalized Lorentz law.},

abstract = {We provide a simple physical proof of the reciprocity theorem of classical electrodynamics in the general case of material media that contain linearly polarizable as well as linearly magnetizable substances. The excitation source is taken to be a point-dipole, either electric or magnetic, and the monitored field at the observation point can be electric or magnetic, regardless of the nature of the source dipole. The electric and magnetic susceptibility tensors of the material system may vary from point to point in space, but they cannot be functions of time. In the case of spatially non-dispersive media, the only other constraint on the local susceptibility tensors is that they be symmetric at each and every point. The proof is readily extended to media that exhibit spatial dispersion: For reciprocity to hold, the electric susceptibility tensor Chi{\_}E{\_}mn that relates the complex-valued magnitude of the electric dipole at location r{\_}m to the strength of the electric field at r{\_}n must be the transpose of Chi{\_}E{\_}nm. Similarly, the necessary and sufficient condition for the magnetic susceptibility tensor is Chi{\_}M{\_}mn = Chi{\^{}}T{\_}M{\_}nm.},

To realize nonreciprocal cloaking, we propose the theory of effective electromagnetic field for photons, which is an extended version of the theory of effective magnetic field for photons. The effective electromagnetic field can be generated using a photonic resonator lattice. The Hamiltonian for a photon in this field has a similar form to that of the Hamiltonian for a charged particle in an electromagnetic field. Incident photons, therefore, experience a Lorentz-like force and a Coulomb-like force and show nonreciprocal movement depending on their traveling direction. We design an actual invisibility cloaking system on the basis of this theory and, with the aid of computer simulation, confirm the nonreciprocal propagation of light needed for nonreciprocal cloaking.},

In this work, we use optomechanical interactions to strongly break reciprocity in a compact system. We derive minimal requirements to create nonreciprocity in a wide class of systems that couple two optical modes to a mechanical mode, highlighting the importance of optically biasing the modes at a controlled phase difference. We realize these principles in a silica microtoroid optomechanical resonator and use quantitative heterodyne spectroscopy to demonstrate up to 10 dB optical isolation at telecom wavelengths. We show that nonreciprocal transmission is preserved for nondegenerate modes, and demonstrate nonreciprocal parametric amplification. These results open a route to exploiting various nonreciprocal effects in optomechanical systems in different electromagnetic and mechanical frequency regimes, including optomechanical metamaterials with topologically non-trivial properties.},

The dislocation of the incident wave front, analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, is still observed. At short wavelengths the scattering is qualitatively similar to the nondispersive case. At moderate wavelengths, however, there are two markedly different scattering regimes according to whether the depth is smaller or larger than √3 times capillary length. In the latter case, dispersion and advection may compensate leading to a spiral interference pattern. The dislocation is characterized by a parameter that depends both on phase and group velocity. The validity range of the calculation is the same as in the shallow water case: wavelengths small compared to vortex radius, and low Mach number.

Here, we establish a unifying theoretical framework to analyze optical nonreciprocity and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in multimode optomechanical systems. We highlight two general scenarios to achieve isolation, relying on either optical or mechanical losses. Depending on the loss mechanism, our theory defines the ultimate requirements for optimal isolation and the available operational bandwidth in these systems. We also analyze the effect of sideband resolution on the performance of optomechanical isolators, highlighting the fact that nonreciprocity can be preserved even in the unresolved sideband regime. Our results provide general insights into a broad class of parametrically modulated nonreciprocal devices, paving the way towards optimal nonreciprocal systems for low-noise integrated nanophotonics.},

abstract = {Acoustically Isolated
The control of sound transmission is desirable in a number of circumstances from noise suppression to imaging technologies. Fleury et al. (p. 516; see the cover; see the Perspective by Cummer) studied a subwavelength acoustic meta-atom consisting of a resonant ring cavity biased by an internally circulating fluid. The direction of rotational flow of the fluid (air) changed the resonant properties of the ring cavity, allowing the propagation of sound waves within the cavity to be controlled. With several ports connected to the cavity, sound could be directed to a certain port while isolating transmission in another.
Acoustic isolation and nonreciprocal sound transmission are highly desirable in many practical scenarios. They may be realized with nonlinear or magneto-acoustic effects, but only at the price of high power levels and impractically large volumes. In contrast, nonreciprocal electromagnetic propagation is commonly achieved based on the Zeeman effect, or modal splitting in ferromagnetic atoms induced by a magnetic bias. Here, we introduce the acoustic analog of this phenomenon in a subwavelength meta-atom consisting of a resonant ring cavity biased by a circulating fluid. The resulting angular momentum bias splits the ring's azimuthal resonant modes, producing giant acoustic nonreciprocity in a compact device. We applied this concept to build a linear, magnetic-free circulator for airborne sound waves, observing up to 40-decibel nonreciprocal isolation at audible frequencies.
Directional fluid flow is used to control and isolate the propagation of sound. [Also see Perspective by Cummer]

Single cavity-waveguide elements, fabricated in the device layer of a silicon-on-insulator microchip, are used to optically excite and detect C-band (∼6 GHz) microwave phonons propagating in phononic-bandgap-guided acoustic waveguides. Interconnecting a pair of optomechanical cavities via a phonon waveguide is then used to demonstrate a tunable delay and filter for microwave-over-optical signals in the 1,500 nm wavelength band. Finally, we realize a tight-binding form of mechanical coupling between distant optomechanical cavities, leading to direct phonon exchange without dissipation in the waveguide. These initial demonstrations indicate the potential of cavity-optomechanical circuits for performing coherent signal processing as well as for realizing new modalities of optical readout in distributed micromechanical sensors.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present work is to trace parallels between the known inertia forces in fluid dynamics with the inertia forces in electromagnetism that are known to induce resistance forces on masses both due to acceleration and at constant velocity. It is shown that the force exerted on a particle by an ideal fluid produces two effects: i) resistance to acceleration and, ii) an increase of mass with velocity. These resistance forces arise due to the fluid dragged by the particle, where the bare mass of the particle at rest changes when in motion ("dressed" particle). It is demonstrated that the vector potential created by a charged particle in motion acts as an ideal space flow that surrounds the particle. The interaction between the particle and the entrained space flow gives rise to the observed properties of inertia and the relativistic increase of mass. Parallels are made between the inertia property of matter, electromagnetism and the hydrodynamic drag in potential flow. Accordingly, in this framework the non resistance of a particle in uniform motion through an ideal fluid (D'Alembert's paradox) corresponds to Newton's first law. The law of inertia suggests that the physical vacuum can be modeled as an ideal fluid, agreeing with the space-time ideal fluid approach from general relativity.},

As common as these applications are, optical materials possess many interesting and complicating properties, which are often ignored. For example, all optical materials absorb light in some spectral regions, and all materials experience dispersion, where the refractive index is a function of the wavelength of light. In this chapter, the basic physics of light interaction with optical materials is presented, primarily to explain many of these commonly observed phenomena. The emphasis of the chapter is on materials that are transparent in the region from the ultraviolet (down to ∼120 nm) to the mid-infrared (up to ∼40 microns). Perturbations of the basic optical properties of materials, such as those due to external strain and electric fields, will also be discussed. The properties of several specific optical materials will be discussed with the intent of demonstrating the basic physics and not to present a comprehensive listing of optical data. Thin films (that is, films with thicknesses on the order of the wavelength of light) are also discussed with the intent of understanding the physics of these materials and how they interact with light to produce the desired affects, such as reducing or enhancing the amount of light transmitted through or reflected from an optical device.},

abstract = {Achieving non-reciprocal light propagation via stimuli that break time-reversal symmetry, without magneto-optics, remains a major challenge for integrated nanophotonic devices. Recently, optomechanical microsystems in which light and vibrational modes are coupled through ponderomotive forces, have demonstrated strong non-reciprocal effects through a variety of techniques, but always using optical pumping. None of these approaches have demonstrated bandwidth exceeding that of the mechanical system, and all of them require optical power, which are both fundamental and practical issues. Here we resolve both of these challenges through breaking of time-reversal symmetry using an acoustic pump in an integrated nanophotonic circuit. GHz-bandwidth optomechanical non-reciprocity is demonstrated using the action of a 2-dimensional surface acoustic wave pump, that simultaneously provides non-zero overlap integral for light-sound interaction and also satisfies the necessary phase-matching. We use this technique to produce a simple frequency shifting isolator (i.e. a non-reciprocal modulator) by means of indirect interband scattering. We demonstrate mode conversion asymmetry up to 15 dB, efficiency as high as 17{\%}, over bandwidth exceeding 1 GHz.},

These effects break time-reversal and parity symmetries, respectively. The calculated line shapes are qualitatively similar to those in the presence of confined geometry or in an absorptive medium: The suppression of long scattering paths reduces the observed peak intensity. For incident light of a given circular polarization, however, Faraday rotation suppresses only backscattered light of the same helicity, whereas optical activity suppresses coherence in the opposite helicity channel and leaves the helicity-preserving channel unaffected. It is shown that the helicity-preserving component of the backscattered peak for electromagnetic waves is quantitatively similar to the peak calculated for scalar waves. This correspondence remains as a function of slab thickness and absorption, in agreement with recent experiments. In contrast, the peak line shapes for linearly polarized incident light exhibit quantitative differences in either linear polarization channel from scalar waves. These results were obtained in the diffusion approximation, and for an uncorrelated random medium.},

Nonreciprocal light transport and one-way photonic mode conversion are demonstrated at the wavelength of 1.55 micrometers in both simulations and experiments. Our system is compatible with conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor processing, providing a way to chip-scale optical isolators for optical communications and computing.

@article{Wang2009b,
abstract = {One of the most striking phenomena in condensed-matter physics is the quantum Hall effect, which arises in two-dimensional electron systems subject to a large magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane in which the electrons reside. In such circumstances, current is carried by electrons along the edges of the system, in so-called chiral edge states (CESs). These are states that, as a consequence of nontrivial topological properties of the bulk electronic band structure, have a unique directionality and are robust against scattering from disorder. Recently, it was theoretically predicted that electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge states could be observed in photonic crystals, which are materials having refractive-index variations with a periodicity comparable to the wavelength of the light passing through them. Here we report the experimental realization and observation of such electromagnetic CESs in a magneto-optical photonic crystal fabricated in the microwave regime. We demonstrate that, like their electronic counterparts, electromagnetic CESs can travel in only one direction and are very robust against scattering from disorder; we find that even large metallic scatterers placed in the path of the propagating edge modes do not induce reflections. These modes may enable the production of new classes of electromagnetic device and experiments that would be impossible using conventional reciprocal photonic states alone. Furthermore, our experimental demonstration and study of photonic CESs provides strong support for the generalization and application of topological band theories to classical and bosonic systems, and may lead to the realization and observation of topological phenomena in a generally much more controlled and customizable fashion than is typically possible with electronic systems.},

Leonhardt and Piwnicki [Phys. Rev. A {\{}$\backslash$bf 60{\}}, 4301 (1999)] argued that a flowing dielectric fluid of this kind can be used to generate an 'optical black hole'. In the Leonhardt-Piwnicki model, only a vortex flow was considered. It was later pointed out by Visser [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\{}$\backslash$bf 85{\}}, 5252 (2000)] that in order to form a proper optical black hole containing an event horizon, it becomes necessary to add an inward radial velocity component to the vortex flow. In the present paper we undertake this task: we consider a full spiral flow, consisting of a vortex component plus a radially infalling component. Light propagates in such a dielectric medium in a way similar to that occurring around a rotating black hole. We calculate, and show graphically, the effective potential versus the radial distance from the vortex singularity, and show that the spiral flow can always capture light in both a positive, and a negative, inverse impact parameter interval. The existence of a genuine event horizon is found to depend on the strength of the radial flow, relative to the strength of the azimuthal flow. A limitation of our fluid model is that it is nondispersive.},

The interference of three coupling fields will split energy levels periodically, to form a periodic refractive index structure with honeycomb profile that can be adjusted by different frequency detunings and intensities of the coupling fields. This in turn will affect the appearance of Dirac cones in momentum space. When the honeycomb lattice sites are helically ordered along the propagation direction, gaps open at Dirac points, and one obtains a PFTI in an atomic vapor. An obliquely incident beam will be able to move along the zigzag edge of the lattice without scattering energy into the PFTI, due to the confinement of edge states. The appearance of Dirac cones and the formation of a photonic Floquet topological insulator can be shut down by the third-order nonlinear susceptibility and opened up by the fifth-order one.},

So far, coherent backscattering of light has been studied extensively for elastic (or Rayleigh) light scattering. The occurrence of inelastic scattering affects the visibility of the backscattering effect by reducing the degree of optical coherence in the diffusion process. Here, we discuss the first experimental observation of a constructive interference effect in the inelastically backscattered Raman radiation from strongly diffusing silicon nanowire random media. The observed phenomenon originates from the coherent nature of the Raman scattering process, which typically occurs on a scale given by the phonon coherence length. We interpret our results in the context of a theoretical model of mixed Rayleigh–Raman random walks to shed light on the role of phase coherence in multiple scattering phenomena.},

In optomechanics, radiation-pressure-induced parametric coupling between optical (photon) and mechanical (phonon) excitations may be used to break time-reversal symmetry, providing the prerequisite for synthetic magnetism. Here we design and fabricate a silicon optomechanical circuit with both optical and mechanical connectivity between two optomechanical cavities. Driving the two cavities with phase-correlated laser light results in a synthetic magnetic flux, which, in combination with dissipative coupling to the mechanical bath, leads to non-reciprocal transport of photons with 35 dB of isolation. Additionally, optical pumping with blue-detuned light manifests as a particle non-conserving interaction between photons and phonons, resulting in directional optical amplification of 12 dB in the isolator through-direction. These results suggest the possibility of using optomechanical circuits to create a more general class of non-reciprocal optical devices, and further, to enable new topological phases for both light and sound on a microchip.},

Because of material incompatibilities in conventional approaches based on the Faraday effect, alternative solutions have resorted to nonlinear processes to obtain one-way transmission. However, dynamic reciprocity in a recent theoretical analysis has pinned down the functionalities of these nonlinear isolators. To bypass such dynamic reciprocity, we here demonstrate an optical isolator on a silicon chip enforced by phase-matched parametric amplification in four-wave mixing. Using a high-Q microtoroid resonator, we realize highly non-reciprocal transport at the 1,550 nm wavelength when waves are injected from both directions in two different operating configurations. Our design, compatible with current complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) techniques, yields convincing isolation performance with sufficiently low insertion loss for a wide range of input power levels.

abstract = {Artificial gauge fields for neutral particles such as photons, recently attracted a lot of attention in various fields ranging from photonic crystals to ultracold atoms in optical lattices to optomechanical arrays. Here we point out that, among all implementations of gauge fields, the optomechanical setting allows for the most natural extension where the gauge field becomes dynamical. The mechanical oscillation phases determine the effective artificial magnetic field for the photons, and once these phases are allowed to evolve, they respond to the flow of photons in the structure. We discuss a simple three-site model where we identify four different regimes of the gauge-field dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the discussion to a two-dimensional lattice. Our proposed scheme could for instance be implemented using optomechanical crystals.},

abstract = {—Optical isolators are required to block undesired re-flections in many photonic integrated circuits (PICs), but the per-formance of on-chip isolators using the magneto-optic effect has been limited due to high loss of such materials. Moreover, they require precise positioning of a permanent magnet close to the chip, increasing footprint and impeding packaging. In this paper, we propose an optical isolator on the silicon-on-insulator platform with record performance and without the use of any external per-manent magnets. A metallic microstrip above the bonded silicon microring (MR) is used to generate the magnetic field required for the nonreciprocal behavior. Simultaneously, the microstrip can be used to provide 0.6 nm of thermal tuning while preserving over 20 dB of isolation. We measure 32 dB of isolation near 1555 nm with only 2.3 dB excess loss in a 35 $\mu$m radius MR. The tunability, compactness, and lack of permanent magnets suggest this device is a major step towards integration in PICs.},

abstract = {Recent progress in understanding the topological properties of condensed matter has led to the discovery of time-reversal-invariant topological insulators. A remarkable and useful property of these materials is that they support unidirectional spin-polarized propagation at their surfaces. Unfortunately topological insulators are rare among solid-state materials. Using suitably designed electromagnetic media (metamaterials) we theoretically demonstrate a photonic analogue of a topological insulator. We show that metacrystals-superlattices of metamaterials with judiciously designed properties-provide a platform for designing topologically non-trivial photonic states, similar to those that have been identified for condensed-matter topological insulators. The interfaces of the metacrystals support helical edge states that exhibit spin-polarized one-way propagation of photons, robust against disorder. Our results demonstrate the possibility of attaining one-way photon transport without application of external magnetic fields or breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Such spin-polarized one-way transport enables exotic spin-cloaked photon sources that do not obscure each other.},

It is universal and accompanies evanescent waves in total internal reflection, waveguides/fibers and surface-states. The hallmark of the recently discovered quantum spin hall (QSH) state of matter is the existence of electronic surface states which are robust to disorder (non-magnetic impurities). This property arises since the spin of the electron is intrinsically locked to the direction of propagation (momentum) and the electrons cannot backscatter unless there is a spin-flip. Recent work on topological photonics has shed light on electromagnetic surface states which are immune to disorder and show similar effects as the electrons. However, the presence of spin-orbit coupling has been considered fundamental to the origin of this spin-momentum locking effect in both electronics and photonics.},

Moreover, optical applications need to be seen in the context of applications of reciprocity in particle scattering, acoustics, seismology and the solution of inverse problems, generally. In some of these other fields vector wave propagation is, as it is in optics, of the essence. For this reason the simplified approach to light wave polarization developed by, and named for, Jones is explored initially to see how and to what extent it encompasses reciprocity. The characteristic matrix of a uniform dielectric layer, used in the analysis of interference filters and mirrors, is reciprocal except when the layer is magneto-optical. The way in which the reciprocal nature of a characteristic matrix can be recognized is discussed next. After this, work on the influence of more realistic attributes of a dielectric stack on reciprocity is reviewed. Some of the numerous technological applications of magneto-optic non-reciprocal media are identified and the potential of a new class of non-reciprocal components is briefly introduced. Finally, the extension of the classical reciprocity concept to systems containing components that have nonlinear optical response is briefly mentioned.},

Optomechanically induced non-reciprocal transparency and amplification are observed and a non-reciprocal phase shift of up to 40° is also demonstrated.

A practical and inexpensive route to magnetic-free non-reciprocity could revolutionize radio-frequency and nanophotonic communication networks. Angular-momentum biasing was recently proposed as a means of realizing isolation for sound waves travelling in a rotating medium, and envisaged as a path towards compact, linear integrated non-reciprocal electromagnetic components. Inspired by this concept, here we demonstrate a subwavelength, linear radio-frequency non-reciprocal circulator free from magnetic materials and bias. The scheme is based on the parametric modulation of three identical, strongly and symmetrically coupled resonators. Their resonant frequencies are modulated by external signals with the same amplitude and a relative phase difference of 120°, imparting an effective electronic angular momentum to the system. We observe giant non-reciprocity, with up to six orders of magnitude difference in transmission for opposite directions. Furthermore, the device topology is tunable in real time, and can be directly embedded in a conventional integrated circuit.},

Self-similar fractal energy structures generally known as Hofstadter butterflies depend sensitively on the geometry of the underlying lattice, as well as the applied magnetic field. The recent demonstration of an adjustable lattice geometry [L. Tarruell, D. Greif, T. Uehlinger, G. Jotzu, and T. Esslinger, Nature (London) 483, 302 (2012)] presents a unique opportunity to study this dependence. In this paper, we calculate the Hofstadter butterflies that can be obtained in such an adjustable lattice and find three qualitatively different regimes. We show that the existence of Dirac points at zero magnetic field does not imply the topological equivalence of spectra at finite field. As the real-space structure evolves from the checkerboard lattice to the honeycomb lattice, two square-lattice Hofstadter butterflies merge to form a honeycomb lattice butterfly. This merging is topologically nontrivial, as it is accomplished by sequential closings of gaps. Ensuing Chern number transfer between the bands can be probed with the adjustable lattice experiments. We also calculate the Chern numbers of the gaps for qualitatively different spectra and discuss the evolution of topological properties with underlying lattice geometry.},

@phdthesis{Qiu2013,
abstract = {In this thesis, we will theoretically explore three nanophotonics phenomena which enable strong light-matter interaction. The first phenomenon is plasmonic resonance, where the surface plasmon mode at metal and dielectric boundaries significantly enhances the optical response of nanoparticles. We propose an optimization-based theoretical approach to tailor the optical response of silver/silica multilayer nanospheres over the visible spectrum. We show that the structure that provides the largest cross-section per volume/mass, averaged over a wide frequency range, is the silver coated silica sphere. We also show how properly chosen mixture of several species of different nanospheres can have an even larger minimal cross-section per volume/mass over the entire visible spectrum. The second phenomenon is photonic chiral edge state, where the breaking of time-reversal symmetry forces light to travel in only one direction. Based on the directional coupling between one-way waveguide and conventional two-waveguide, we propose a new type of optical circulators, which has the potential for simultaneous broadband operation and small device footprint. The third phenomenon is Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS), where photon and phonon are coupled through optical forces such as electrostriction force and radiation pressure. We develop a general method of calculating SBS gain via the overlap integral between optical and elastic modes. Applying this method to a rectangular waveguide, we demonstrate that the distribution of optical force and elastic modal profile jointly determine the magnitude and scaling of SBS gains. Applying this method to a periodic waveguide, we demonstrate that SBS gain can be further enhanced in the slow light regime. Based on this framework, we theoretically characterize a novel class of hybrid photon-phonon waveguides. Our analysis reveals that photon-phonon coupling via SBS can be directed and tailored over an exceptionally wide frequency range, enabling a host of chip-scale filtering, delay, and signal processing schemes.},

@article{Champagne2001,
abstract = {A new 3D code for electromagnetic induction tomography with intended applications to environmental imaging problems has been developed. The approach consists of calculating the fields within a volume using an implicit finite-difference frequency-domain formulation. The volume is terminated by an anisotropic perfectly matched layer region that simulates an infinite domain by absorbing outgoing waves. Extensive validation of this code has been done using analytical and semianalytical results from other codes, and some of those results are presented in this paper. The new code is written in Fortran 90 and is designed to be easily parallelized. Finally, an adjoint field method of data inversion, developed in parallel for solving the fully nonlinear inverse problem for electrical conductivity imaging (e.g., for mapping underground conducting plumes), uses this code to provide solvers for both forward and adjoint fields. Results obtained from this inversion method for high-contrast media are encouraging and provide a significant improvement over those obtained from linearized inversion methods.},

abstract = {As they travel through space, some light beams rotate. Such light beams have angular momentum. There are two particularly important ways in which a light beam can rotate: if every polarization vector rotates, the light has spin; if the phase structure rotates, the light has orbital angular momentum (OAM), which can be many times greater than the spin. Only in the past 20 years has it been realized that beams carrying OAM, which have an optical vortex along the axis, can be easily made in the laboratory. These light beams are able to spin microscopic objects, give rise to rotational frequency shifts, create new forms of imaging systems, and behave within nonlinear material to give new insights into quantum optics.},

abstract = {Topological insulators are a new phase of matter, with the striking property that conduction of electrons occurs only on their surfaces. In two dimensions, electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are not scattered despite defects and disorder, providing robustness akin to that of superconductors. Topological insulators are predicted to have wide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics. Substantial effort has been directed towards realizing topological insulators for electromagnetic waves. One-dimensional systems with topological edge states have been demonstrated, but these states are zero-dimensional and therefore exhibit no transport properties. Topological protection of microwaves has been observed using a mechanism similar to the quantum Hall effect, by placing a gyromagnetic photonic crystal in an external magnetic field. But because magnetic effects are very weak at optical frequencies, realizing photonic topological insulators with scatter-free edge states requires a fundamentally different mechanism-one that is free of magnetic fields. A number of proposals for photonic topological transport have been put forward recently. One suggested temporal modulation of a photonic crystal, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing one-way edge states. This is in the spirit of the proposed Floquet topological insulators, in which temporal variations in solid-state systems induce topological edge states. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a photonic topological insulator free of external fields and with scatter-free edge transport-a photonic lattice exhibiting topologically protected transport of visible light on the lattice edges. Our system is composed of an array of evanescently coupled helical waveguides arranged in a graphene-like honeycomb lattice. Paraxial diffraction of light is described by a Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation where the propagation coordinate (z) acts as 'time'. Thus the helicity of the waveguides breaks z-reversal symmetry as proposed for Floquet topological insulators. This structure results in one-way edge states that are topologically protected from scattering.},

To overcome this challenge, we present a multi-frequency finite-difference frequency-domain algorithm that efficiently performs first-principles steady-state simulations in active devices. We validate our algorithm by simulating a modulated waveguide device and find that the result of the simulation is in excellent agreement with that of coupled mode theory, while also revealing features that are neglected in typical coupled mode theory treatments.

abstract = {One of the most striking phenomena in condensed-matter physics is the quantum Hall effect, which arises in two-dimensional electron systems subject to a large magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane in which the electrons reside. In such circumstances, current is carried by electrons along the edges of the system, in so-called chiral edge states (CESs). These are states that, as a consequence of nontrivial topological properties of the bulk electronic band structure, have a unique directionality and are robust against scattering from disorder. Recently, it was theoretically predicted that electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge states could be observed in photonic crystals, which are materials having refractive-index variations with a periodicity comparable to the wavelength of the light passing through them. Here we report the experimental realization and observation of such electromagnetic CESs in a magneto-optical photonic crystal fabricated in the microwave regime. We demonstrate that, like their electronic counterparts, electromagnetic CESs can travel in only one direction and are very robust against scattering from disorder; we find that even large metallic scatterers placed in the path of the propagating edge modes do not induce reflections. These modes may enable the production of new classes of electromagnetic device and experiments that would be impossible using conventional reciprocal photonic states alone. Furthermore, our experimental demonstration and study of photonic CESs provides strong support for the generalization and application of topological band theories to classical and bosonic systems, and may lead to the realization and observation of topological phenomena in a generally much more controlled and customizable fashion than is typically possible with electronic systems.},

abstract = {Following the discovery of the quantum Hall eeect 1,2 and topological insulators 3,4 , the topological properties of classical waves began to draw attention 5–21 . Topologically non-trivial bands characterized by non-zero Chern numbers are realized through either the breaking of time-reversal symmetry using an external magnetic field 5–7,15,16 or dynamic modulation 8,17 . Owing to the absence of a Faraday-like eeect, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in an acoustic system is commonly realized with moving background fluids 20,22 , which drastically increases the engineering complexity. Here we show that we can realize eeective inversion symmetry breaking and create an eeective gauge flux in a reduced two-dimensional system by engineering interlayer couplings, achieving an acoustic analogue of the topological Haldane model 2,23 . We show that the synthetic gauge flux is closely related to Weyl points 24–26 in the three-dimensional band structure and the system supports chiral edge states for fixed values of k z . Sound is probably the 'simplest' of all classical waves. It has no intrinsic spin and does not respond to magnetic fields; hence, the fundamental interactions underlying the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) and quantum Hall effect (QHE) do not apply to acoustic waves. However, by engineering the coupling in the z direction, we can create synthetic staggered flux and hence k z -preserved unidirectional edge modes in the x–y plane in acoustic meta-crystals which have simple 'static' structures with no moving fluid and no dynamic modulation. The acoustic meta-crystals have Weyl points 24–26 in the three-dimensional (3D) band structure, and the systems are acoustic analogues of the topological Haldane model 2,23 for fixed values of k z . Tight-binding model To illustrate how the idea works, we start with a simple nearest-neighbour tight-binding model for an AA-stacked honeycomb lattice (Fig. 1a). Its acoustic implementation will be discussed later. The Hamiltonian H of this system consists of the intralayer part H 0 and the interlayer part H 1 . (t n a i,k b j,k + H.c.) (1) where a (b) and a (b) are the annihilation and creation operators on the sublattice sites, $\epsilon$ represents the on-site energy difference. Each lattice is specified by subscripts (i, k), where the first labels the position in each layer and the second labels the number of layers. The first term in equation (1) represents the sublattice on-site energy difference. The second term represents the intralayer hopping between nearest sublattices. The intralayer hopping t n is real and constant. The first Brillouin zone (BZ) of this lattice is shown in Fig. 1c. As this system is periodic along the z direction, k z is a good quantum number. For each fixed k z , and if we consider the dispersion and transport in the x–y plane, the 3D system can be reduced to an effective two-dimensional (2D) system with a unit cell, as shown in Fig. 1b. The corresponding first BZ is illustrated in Fig. 1d, which represents a plane cut with the specified k z in the original first BZ in Fig. 1c. We can now introduce different kinds of interlayer coupling, from which we choose two special examples (Fig. 1e,g, where hopping is non-zero only between connected sites). In Fig. 1e, the hopping amplitudes are different for the two different sublattices. In this case, the interlayer hopping part H 1 is given by},

abstract = {Magnetic effects at optical frequencies are notoriously weak, so magneto-optical devices must be large to create a sufficient effect. In graphene, it has been shown that inhomogeneous strains can induce ‘pseudomagnetic fields' that behave in a similar manner to real ones. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that it is possible to induce such a field at optical frequencies in a photonic lattice. To our knowledge, this is the first realization of a pseudomagnetic field in optics. The field yields ‘photonic Landau levels' separated by bandgaps in the spatial spectrum of the structured dielectric lattice. The gaps between these highly degenerate levels lead to transverse optical confinement. The use of strain allows for the exploration of magnetic-like effects in a non-resonant way that would be otherwise inaccessible in optics. It also suggests the possibility that aperiodic photonic-crystal structures can achieve greater field enhancement and slow-light effects than periodic structures via high density of states at the Landau levels. Generalizing these concepts to systems beyond optics, such as matter waves in optical potentials, offers new intriguing physics that is fundamentally different from that in purely periodic structures.},

@article{Tsakmakidis2017a,
abstract = {Resonant systems with high bandwidth
The performance of an active system, whether it is optical, electrical, or mechanical, is often described by its quality (Q) factor. Typically, one learns the rule that the higher the Q factor, the sharper the resonance—that is, the bandwidth of the device is reduced. Tsakmakidis et al. show that this is indeed the case, but only for symmetric systems. However, for the case of asymmetric (or nonreciprocal) systems, the rule need not be obeyed. They show theoretically that the more asymmetric a system with high Q is, the wider the bandwidth can be. The effect raises the prospect of designing high-Q devices operating over large bandwidths.
Science, this issue p. 1260
A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth $\Delta$$\omega$, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period $\Delta$t inversely proportional to the bandwidth ($\Delta$t{\textperiodcentered}$\Delta$$\omega$ {\~{}} 2$\pi$). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.
Asymmetric materials provide the prospect of designing high–quality-factor devices with high bandwidth.

Until now, there have been no techniques that provide complete on-chip signal isolation using materials or processes that are fundamentally compatible with silicon CMOS processes. Based on the effects of photonic transitions, we show here that a linear, broadband and non-reciprocal isolation can be accomplished by spatial–temporal refractive index modulations that simultaneously impart frequency and wavevector shifts during the photonic transition process. We further show that a non-reciprocal effect can be accomplished in dynamically modulated micrometre-scale ring-resonator structures.

abstract = {Non-reciprocal photonic devices, including optical isolators and circulators, are indispensible components in optical communi-cation systems. However, the integration of such devices on semiconductor platforms has been challenging because of material incompatibilities between semiconductors and magneto-optical materials that necessitate wafer bonding, and because of the large footprint of isolator designs. Here, we report the first monolithically integrated magneto-optical isolator on silicon. Using a non-reciprocal optical resonator on an silicon-on-insulator substrate, we demonstrate uni-directional optical transmission with an isolation ratio up to 19.5 dB near the 1,550 nm telecommunication wavelength in a homogeneous external magnetic field. Our device has a small footprint that is 290 mm in length, significantly smaller than a conventional integrated optical isolator on a single crystal garnet substrate. This monolithically integrated non-reciprocal optical resonator may serve as a fundamental building block in a variety of ultracompact silicon photonic devices including optical isolators and circulators, enabling future low-cost, large-scale integration. Non-reciprocal photonic devices that break the time-reversal symmetry of light propagation provide critical functionalities such as optical isolation and circulation in photonic systems. Although widely used in optical communications, such devices are still lacking in semiconductor integrated photonic systems 1,2 because of challenges in both materials integration and device design. On the materials side, magneto-optical garnets used in discrete non-reciprocal photonic devices show large lattice and thermal mis-match with semiconductor substrates, making it difficult to achieve monolithic integration of garnets with phase purity, high Faraday rotation and low transmission loss 3,4 , and requiring wafer bonding to incorporate them on a semiconductor platform. On the device side, non-reciprocal mode conversion (NRMC) and non-reciprocal phase shift (NRPS) integrated optical isolators have large footprints with length scales from millimetres to centi-metres 5,6 , which severely limits the feasibility of large-scale and low-cost integration. Efforts have been pursued both in the mono-lithic integration of iron garnet and the exploration of other magneto-optical materials with better semiconductor compatibility. Polycrystalline Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 (YIG) films 3 , epitaxial Sr(Ti 1–x Fe x)O 3–d (ref. 7), Sr(Ti 1–x Co x)O 3–d (ref. 8) and Fe-doped InP films 9 have been demonstrated to have promising magneto-optical performance at a wavelength of 1,550 nm. In relation to device design, several monolithic non-reciprocal photonic devices capitalizing on optical resonance effects (for example, magneto-optical photonic crystals 10 , garnet thin-film based optical resonators 11 , silicon ring resonators with magneto-optical polymer cladding 12 and modulated ring resonators using non-reciprocal photonic transitions 1) have been theoretically analysed with a view to reducing the device footprint. However, the experimental realization of monolithic integrated devices on silicon has not been demonstrated so far due to material and fabrication difficulties. Currently, the only experimentally demon-strated optical isolators on silicon still rely on wafer bonding of Ce-doped yttrium iron garnet films grown on garnet single crystals to a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) Mach–Zehnder structure 13 or to an SOI ring resonator 14},

abstract = {Recent advances in silicon ring-resonator arrays have stimulated the development of topological lattices for photons, with potential applications in integrated photonic devices. Taking inspiration from ultracold atoms, we propose how such arrays can be extended into an additional synthetic dimension by coupling together the different modes of each ring resonator.1 In this way, a 1D resonator chain can become an effective 2D system, while a 3D resonator array can be exploited as a 4D photonic lattice. As an example of the power of this approach, we discuss how to experimentally realise an optical analogue of the 4D quantum Hall effect for the first time. This opens up the way towards the exploration of higher-dimensional lattices in integrated photonics.},

Recent works have therefore explored nonlinear optical isolators and demonstrated non-reciprocal transmission contrast when waves are injected in forward or backward directions. However, whether such nonlinear isolators can provide complete isolation under practical operating conditions remains an open question. Here, we analytically prove and numerically demonstrate a dynamic reciprocity in nonlinear optical isolators based on Kerr or Kerr-like nonlinearity. We show that, when a signal is transmitting through, such isolators are constrained by a reciprocity relation for a class of small-amplitude additional waves and, as a result, cannot provide isolation for arbitrary backward-propagating noise. This result points to an important limitation on the use of nonlinear optical isolators for signal processing and for laser protection.},

The significant challenges that confront integration of magneto-optic nonreciprocal systems on chip have made imperative the exploration of magnet free alternatives. However, none of these approaches have yet demonstrated linear optical isolation with ideal characteristics over a microscale footprint – simultaneously incorporating large contrast with ultralow forward loss – having fundamental compatibility with photonic integration in standard waveguide materials. Here we demonstrate that complete linear optical isolation can be obtained within any dielectric waveguide using only a whispering-gallery microresonator pumped by a single-frequency laser. The isolation originates from a nonreciprocal induced transparency based on a coherent light-sound interaction, with the coupling originating from the traveling-wave Brillouin scattering interaction, that breaks time-reversal symmetry within the waveguide-resonator system. Our result demonstrates that material-agnostic and wavelength-agnostic optical isolation is far more accessible for chip-scale photonics than previously thought.},

abstract = {In this letter, we report the presence of novel type of plasmon Weyl points in a naturally existing material - magnetized plasma. In such a medium, conventional, purely longitudinal bulk plasma oscillations exists only along the direction of applied magnetic field (z direction). With strong enough magnetic field, there exist helical propagating modes along z direction with circular polarizations. The orthogonality between the longitudinal bulk plasmon mode and the transverse helical propagating modes guarantees their crossing at the bulk plasmon frequency. These crossing points, embedded in the bulk plasmon dispersion line, serve as monopoles in the k space - the so called Weyl points. These Weyl points lead to salient observable features. These include the highly intriguing observation that, at a magnetized plasma surface which is parallel to the applied magnetic field, reflection of an electromagnetic wave with in-plane wave-vector close to the Weyl points exhibits chiral behavior only in half of the k plane, which is bounded by the projection of the bulk plasmon dispersion line. We also verify the presence of 'Fermi arcs' connecting the two Weyl points with opposite chiralities when magnetized plasma interfaces with trivial photonic materials. Our study introduces the concept of Weyl photonics into homogeneous strongly dispersive photonic materials, which could pave way for realizing new topological photonic devices.},

SF6 is found to be preferable to CF4 for dielectricetching because of an absence of polymer formation. This produces smoother SiO2 sidewalls. Flood exposure of theinitial photoresist mask and optimization of the postbake temperature also produces smoother sidewalls on the subsequently etched SiO2. The sidewall can also be protected from roughening that occurs during the dry etch step by coating it with a low temperature SiN layer. A combination of all of these methods produces sidewalls with morphological variations of ≤500 {\AA}.},

Here we propose a new route for engineering all-optical devices using photon internal degrees of freedom, which form photonic crystals in such synthetic dimensions for photon propagation and interference. We demonstrate this new design concept by showing how important optical devices such as quantum memory and optical filter can be realized using synthetic orbital angular momentum (OAM) lattices in a single main degenerate cavity.

abstract = {Reciprocity is a general, fundamental principle governing various physical systems, which ensures that the transfer function—the transmission of a physical quantity, say light intensity—between any two points in space is identical, regardless of geometrical or material asymmetries. Breaking this transmission symmetry offers enhanced control over signal transport, isolation and source protection. So far, devices that break reciprocity (and therefore show non-reciprocity) have been mostly considered in dynamic systems involving electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical wave propagation associated with fields varying in space and time. Here we show that it is possible to break reciprocity in static systems, realizing mechanical metamaterials that exhibit vastly different output displacements under excitation from different sides, as well as one-way displacement amplification. This is achieved by combining large nonlinearities with suitable geometrical asymmetries and/or topological features. In addition to extending non-reciprocity and isolation to statics, our work sheds light on energy propagation in nonlinear materials with asymmetric crystalline structures and topological properties. We anticipate that breaking reciprocity will open avenues for energy absorption, conversion and harvesting, soft robotics, prosthetics and optomechanics.},

The physical reason of this phenomenon is intimately connected with the dimensional spatial reduction {\$}3 \backslashto 1{\$} in the dynamics of the lowest Landau level. The off-diagonal component of the transverse (with respect to the direction of the magnetic field) conductivity in Weyl semimetals contains an anomalous contribution directly proportional to the momentum space separation between the Weyl nodes. This contribution comes exclusively from the lowest Landau level and, as expected, is independent of the temperature, chemical potential, and magnetic field. The other part of the off-diagonal conductivity is the same as in Dirac semimetals and is connected with a nonzero density of charge carriers. The signatures for experimental distinguishing Weyl semimetals from Dirac ones through the measurements of conductivity are discussed.},

abstract = {When a neutral atom moves in a properly designed laser field, its center-of-mass motion may mimic the dynamics of a charged particle in a magnetic field, with the emergence of a Lorentz-like force. In this Colloquium the physical principles at the basis of this artificial (synthetic) magnetism are presented. The corresponding Aharonov-Bohm phase is related to the Berry's phase that emerges when the atom adiabatically follows one of the dressed states of the atom-laser interaction. Some manifestations of artificial magnetism for a cold quantum gas, in particular, in terms of vortex nucleation are discussed. The analysis is then generalized to the simulation of non-Abelian gauge potentials and some striking consequences are presented, such as the emergence of an effective spin-orbit coupling. Both the cases of bulk gases and discrete systems, where atoms are trapped in an optical lattice, are addressed.},

abstract = {The field of metamaterials has opened landscapes of possibilities in basic science, and a paradigm shift in the way we think about and design emergent material properties. In many scenarios, metamaterial concepts have helped overcome long-held scientific challenges, such as the absence of optical magnetism and the limits imposed by diffraction in optical imaging. As the potential of metamaterials, as well as their limitations, become clearer, these advances in basic science have started to make an impact on several applications in different areas, with far-reaching implications for many scientific and engineering fields. At optical frequencies, the alliance of metamaterials with the fields of plasmonics and nanophotonics can further advance the possibility of controlling light propagation, radiation, localization and scattering in unprecedented ways. In this review article, we discuss the recent progress in the field of metamaterials, with particular focus on how fundamental advances in this field are enabling a new generation of metamaterial, plasmonic and nanophotonic devices. Relevant examples include optical nanocircuits and nanoantennas, invisibility cloaks, superscatterers and superabsorbers, metasurfaces for wavefront shaping and wave-based analog computing, as well as active, nonreciprocal and topological devices. Throughout the paper, we highlight the fundamental limitations and practical challenges associated with the realization of advanced functionalities, and we suggest potential directions to go beyond these limits. Over the next few years, as new scientific breakthroughs are translated into technological advances, the fields of metamaterials, plasmonics and nanophotonics are expected to have a broad impact on a variety of applications in areas of scientific, industrial and societal significance.},

abstract = {In 1959 Aharonov and Bohm suggested that an electron passing around a long solenoid would pick up a phase shift dependent on the magnetic field of the solenoid, even though the electrons themselves pass through a region of space which has a zero magnetic field. It has long been held that this result is purely quantum and is derived in many well known quantum mechanics text books using the Schrodinger equation and vector potential. Here the same phase shift is derived from a purely classical force, but relativistic transformations are taken into account. The force is in the direction of motion of the electron (or opposite) leading to a phase advance (or lag) and we obtain precisely the phase shift thought previously to be purely quantum. The only quantum result used here is the de Broglie wavelength of the particle, in order to get two slit like interference and the phase shift. We employ a stack of dipoles as the solenoid and note the same force on the electron in two different frames of reference. We shall consider the solenoid stationary and the electron moving, and then consider the electron rest frame and consider the solenoid moving in the opposite direction.},

The frequency shift induced by the change rate of Pancharatnam-Berry phase with time is derived from both the Jones matrix calculations and the theory of the hybrid-order Poincar{\'{e}} sphere.

@article{Bromberg2016,
abstract = {Reciprocity is a universal principle that has a profound impact on many areas of physics. A fundamental phenomenon in condensed-matter physics, optical physics and acoustics, arising from reciprocity, is the constructive interference of quantum or classical waves which propagate along time-reversed paths in disordered media, leading to, for example, weak localization and metal-insulator transition. Previous studies have shown that such coherent effects are suppressed when reciprocity is broken. Here we show that by breaking reciprocity in a controlled manner, we can tune, rather than simply suppress, these phenomena. In particular, we manipulate coherent backscattering of light, also known as weak localization. By utilizing a non-reciprocal magneto-optical effect, we control the interference between time-reversed paths inside a multimode fiber with strong mode mixing, and realize a continuous transition from the well-known peak to a dip in the backscattered intensity. Our results may open new possibilities for coherent control of classical and quantum waves in complex systems},

abstract = {The spin–orbit interaction (SOI) of light has been intensively studied in nanophotonics because it enables sensitive control of photons' spin degree of freedom and thereby the trajectories of the photons, which is useful for applications such as signal encoding and routing. A recent study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 166803 (2016)] showed that the SOI of photons manifests in the presence of a gradient in the permittivity of the medium through which the photons propagate; this enhances the scattering of circularly polarized light and results in the photons propagating along twisted trajectories. Here we theoretically predict that, because of the equivalence between an inhomogeneous dielectric medium and a gravitational field demonstrated in transformation optics, a significant SOI is induced onto circularly polarized light passing by the gravitational lens of a black hole. This leads to: i) the photons to propagate along chiral trajectories if the size of the black hole is smaller than the wavelength of the incident photons; ii) the resulting image of the gravitational lens to manifest an azimuthal rotation because of these chiral trajectories. The findings open for a way to probe for and discover subwavelength-size black holes using circularly polarized light.},

The applications of SR's include artificial negative magnetic permeability media (NMPM) and left-handed-media (LHM) design. The main advantages of SR's for such purpose are small electrical size at resonance, absence of magnetoelectric coupling (thus avoiding bianisotropic effects in the continuous medium made of these particles), and easy fabrication.

Deeper understanding of the role of topology in physics has led to a new class of matter: topologically - ordered systems. The best known examples are quantum Hall effects, where insensitivity to local properties manifests itself as conductance through edge states that is insensitive to defects and disorder. Current research in engineering topological order primarily focuses on analogies to quantum Hall systems, where the required magnetic field is synthesized in non-magnetic systems. Here, we realize synthetic magnetic fields for photons at room temperature, using linear Silicon photonics. We observe, for the first time, topological edge states of light in a two - dimensional system and show their robustness against intrinsic and introduced disorder. Our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using photonics to realize topological order in both the non-interacting and many-body regimes.},

In the forward propagation direction, an input TM polarized beam experiences a perfect state transfer between the input and output waveguide channels while surface Bloch oscillations block the backward transmission between the same ports. Our analysis indicates a large isolation ratio of 75 dB after a propagation distance of 8 mm inside seven coupled waveguides.

To miniaturizing these devices down to a single-wavelength scale, we study nonreciprocal effects in point defects of magneto-optical photonic crystals. The nonreciprocal effect splits degenerate mode pairs and its strength is maximized by spatially matching the magnetic domain pattern with a modal cross product. The resultant eigenmodes are a pair of counter-rotating states that lack time-reversal symmetry. Based upon these eigenmodes, we propose a micro-cavity four-port circulator constructed by coupling a magneto-optical cavity with two waveguides, where each rotating state supports light tunneling along a different direction. In the presence of strong magneto-optical couplings, due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, the performance of the isolator is fundamentally protected from the effect of small structural fluctuations. Numerical calculations demonstrate a four-port circulator with a 26 dB isolation and a roughness tolerance on the order of 0.1a, where a is the lattice constant of the crystal.},

However, recent theoretical work has shown that an effective magnetic field for photons can exist if the phase of light would change with its propagating direction. This direction-dependent phase indicates the presence of an effective magnetic field as shown for electrons experimentally in the Aharonov-Bohm experiment. Here we replicate this experiment using photons. In order to create this effective magnetic field, we construct an on-chip silicon-based Ramsey-type interferometer. This interferometer has been traditionally used to probe the phase of atomic states, and here we apply it to probe the phase of photonic states. We experimentally observe a phase change, i.e. an effective magnetic field flux from 0 to 2pi. In an Aharonov-Bohm configuration for electrons, considering the device geometry, this flux corresponds to an effective magnetic field of 0.2 Gauss.},

abstract = {We discuss how one can realize a photonic device that combines synthetic dimensions and synthetic magnetic fields with spatially local interactions. Using an array of ring resonators, the angular coordinate around each resonator spans the synthetic dimension and the synthetic magnetic field arises as the inter-cavity photon hopping is associated to a change of angular momentum. Photon-photon interactions due to the non-linearity of the cavity material are local in the periodic angular coordinate around each ring resonator. Experimentally observable consequences of the synthetic magnetic field and of the local interactions are pointed out.},

abstract = {The Letter develops a modified geometrical optics (GO) of smoothly inhomogeneous isotropic medium, which takes into account two topological phenomena: Berry phase and the optical Magnus effect. Taking into account the correspondence between a quasi-classical motion of a quantum particle with a spin and GO of an electromagnetic wave in smoothly inhomogeneous media, we have introduced the standard gauge potential associated with the degeneracy in the wave momentum space. This potential corresponds to the magnetic-monopole-like field (Berry curvature), which causes the topological spin (polarization) transport of photons. The deviations of waves of right-hand and left-hand polarization occur in the opposite directions and orthogonally to the principal direction of motion. This produces a spin current directed across the principal motion. The situation is similar to the anomalous Hall effect for electrons. In addition, a simple scheme of the experiment allowing one to observe the topological spin splitting of photons has been suggested.},

When the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is ignored, the material is a host to three-dimensional topological nodal-line semimetal states. Drumhead like surface states protected by the coexistence of time-reversal and mirror symmetry emerge within the two-dimensional regions of the surface Brillouin zone connecting the nodal lines. When SOC is included, unexpectedly, each nodal line evolves into two Weyl nodes (W1, W2) in this centrosymmetric material. Berry curvature calculations show that these nodes occur in a pair and act as either a source or sink of Berry flux. The material also has unique surface states in the form of Fermi arcs, which unlike other known Weyl semimetal, form closed loops of surface states on the Fermi surface. Our theoretical realization of topologically non-trivial states in a superconducting material paves the way towards unraveling the interconnection between topological physics and superconductivity.},

By applying a square wave to the integrated phase modulator, we can make the structure work at the highest sensitivity. After applied the square wave, the system runs at linear zone, thus the angular velocity can be obtained according to the linear relationship between the phase difference and the angular velocity. The optimal parameters for the largest phase difference of light signal monitored at different output ports are investigated.

Nano-optics, photonics and plasmonics tend to explore subwavelength scales and additional degrees of freedom of structured — that is, spatially inhomogeneous — optical fields. In such fields, spin and orbital properties become strongly coupled with each other. In this Review we cover the fundamental origins and important applications of the main spin–orbit interaction phenomena in optics. These include: spin-Hall effects in inhomogeneous media and at optical interfaces, spin-dependent effects in nonparaxial (focused or scattered) fields, spin-controlled shaping of light using anisotropic structured interfaces (metasurfaces) and robust spin-directional coupling via evanescent near fields. We show that spin–orbit interactions are inherent in all basic optical processes, and that they play a crucial role in modern optics.},

Its operation at a wavelength of 1.55 microm was confirmed by observation of the output mode profiles. The cross talk measured by an indirect method was {\textgreater}10.2 dB. The excess loss with reference to a straight multimode waveguide was 1.5 dB, compared with the propagation loss of a straight multimode waveguide.},

@article{Reed2010,
abstract = {Optical technology is poised to revolutionize short-reach interconnects. The leading candidate technology is silicon photonics, and the workhorse of such an interconnect is the optical modulator. Modulators have been improved dramatically in recent years, with a notable increase in bandwidth from the megahertz to the multigigahertz regime in just over half a decade. However, the demands of optical interconnects are significant, and many questions remain unanswered as to whether silicon can meet the required performance metrics. Minimizing metrics such as the device footprint and energy requirement per bit, while also maximizing bandwidth and modulation depth, is non-trivial. All of this must be achieved within an acceptable thermal tolerance and optical spectral width using CMOS-compatible fabrication processes. This Review discusses the techniques that have been (and will continue to be) used to implement silicon optical modulators, as well as providing an outlook for these devices and the candidate solutions of the future.},

@article{Deak2012,
abstract = {The reciprocity principle is that, when an emitted wave gets scattered on an object, the scattering transition amplitude does not change if we interchange the source and the detector—in other words, if incoming waves are interchanged with appropriate outgoing ones. Reciprocity is sometimes confused with time reversal invariance, or with invariance under the rotation that interchanges the location of the source and the location of the detector. Actually, reciprocity covers the former as a special case, and is fundamentally different from–but can be usefully combined with–the latter. Reciprocity can be proved as a theorem in many situations and is found violated in other cases. The paper presents a general treatment of reciprocity, discusses important examples, shows applications in the field of photon (M{\"{o}}ssbauer) scattering, and establishes a fruitful connection with a recently developing area of mathematics.},

abstract = {Weyl fermions1 do not appear in nature as elementary particles, but they are now found to exist as nodal points in the band structure of electronic and classical wave crystals. Novel phenomena such as Fermi arcs and chiral anomaly have fueled the interest of these topological points which are frequently perceived as monopoles in momentum space. Here, we demonstrate that generalized Weyl points can exist in a parameter space and we report the first observation of such nodal points in one-dimensional photonic crystals in the optical range. The reflection phase inside the band gap of a truncated photonic crystal exhibits vortexes in the parameter space where the Weyl points are defined and they share the same topological charges as the Weyl points. These vortexes guarantee the existence of interface states, the trajectory of which can be understood as "Fermi arcs" emerging from the Weyl nodes.},

abstract = {We perform a detail study of higher dimensional quantum Hall effects and A-class topological insulators with emphasis on their relations to non-commutative geometry. There are two different formulations of non-commutative geometry for higher dimensional fuzzy spheres; the ordinary commutator formulation and quantum Nambu bracket formulation. Corresponding to these formulations, we introduce two kinds of monopole gauge fields; non-abelian gauge field and antisymmetric tensor gauge field, which respectively realize the non-commutative geometry of fuzzy sphere in the lowest Landau level. We establish connection between the two types of monopole gauge fields through Chern-Simons term, and derive explicit form of tensor monopole gauge fields with higher string-like singularity. The connection between two types of monopole is applied to generalize the concept of flux attachment in quantum Hall effect to A-class topological insulator. We propose tensor type Chern-Simons theory as the effective field theory for membranes in A-class topological insulators. Membranes turn out to be fractionally charged objects and the phase entanglement mediated by tensor gauge field transforms the membrane statistics to be anyonic. The index theorem supports the dimensional hierarchy of A-class topological insulator. Analogies to D-brane physics of string theory are discussed too.},

@article{Kamal2011a,
abstract = {Non-reciprocal devices such as circulators and isolators belong to an important class of microwave components employed in applications including the measurement of mesoscopic circuits at cryogenic temperatures. The measurement protocols usually involve an amplification chain that relies on circulators to separate input and output channels and to suppress backaction from different stages on the sample under test. In these devices the usual reciprocal symmetry of circuits is broken by the phenomenon of Faraday rotation based on magnetic materials and fields. However, magnets are averse to on-chip integration, and magnetic fields are deleterious to delicate superconducting devices. Here we present a new proposal that combines two stages of parametric modulation to emulate the action of a circulator. It is devoid of magnetic components and suitable for on-chip integration. As the design is free of any dissipative elements and based on reversible operation, the device operates noiselessly, giving it an important advantage over other non-reciprocal active devices for quantum information processing applications.},

abstract = {The newly popular topic of "phonon diodes" is discussed in the context of a broader issue of reciprocity in reflection/transmission (R-T) of waves. We first review a theorem well known in electromagnetism and optics but underappreciated in acoustics and phonon physics, stating that the matrix of R-T coefficients for properly normalized amplitudes is symmetric for linear systems that conform to power conservation and time reversibility for wave fields. It is shown that linear structures proposed for "acoustic diodes" in fact do obey R-T reciprocity, and thus should not strictly be called diodes or isolators. We also review examples of nonlinear designs violating reciprocity, and conclude that an efficient acoustic isolator has not yet been demonstrated. Finally, we consider the relationship between acoustic isolators and "thermal diodes", and show that ballistic phonon transport through a linear structure, whether an acoustic diode or not, is unlikely to form the basis for a thermal diode.},

In a more general geometrical framework, such phase alterations have been the hallmark of a host of related phenomena in many different fields. However, besides phase changes, it was suggested that for finite wave-packets there is also an additional deflection leading to observable changes in the wave's canonical momentum. In this paper, we create an optical scattering situation that permits observing nonconservative reaction forces, which result from the conservation of canonical momentum. We demonstrate experimentally, for the first time, the presence of such mechanical forces with the magnitude and direction determined by the phase dislocation of the vortex state. Our experimental results offer insights into essentially untested phenomena, where forces act on vortex fields, and allow examining the role of conservation laws and symmetries in complex interacting systems.},
